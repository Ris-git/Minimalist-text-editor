**Built a production-ready, offline-first text editor** using vanilla JavaScript and IndexedDB, achieving sub-100ms save latency with debounced auto-save and zero dependency overhead

### 2. Integration & Security
**Implemented OAuth 2.0 integration architecture** with Google Drive and Dropbox APIs using PKCE flow, enabling optional cloud sync while maintaining strict data privacy (no backend required)

### 3. Modern Web Technologies
**Designed and implemented a progressive web application** with service worker for offline functionality, manifest for installability, and CSS variables for seamless theme switching

### 4. User Experience
**Created a minimalist, keyboard-first UX** with real-time word count, reading time estimates, and export capabilities (TXT/MD), prioritizing writer productivity over feature bloat

### 5. System Architecture
**Architected a local-first data storage solution** using IndexedDB with automatic conflict resolution and quota management, ensuring data persistence without server dependency

## Alternative/Additional Bullets

### Technical Depth
- **Developed a zero-dependency text editor** from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating mastery of DOM APIs, IndexedDB, and modern ES6+ features

### Product Thinking
- **Designed a privacy-first writing application** with local-first architecture, ensuring user data never leaves their device without explicit consent

### Performance
- **Optimized editor performance** with debounced auto-save (500ms), efficient DOM updates, and IndexedDB batch operations, handling documents of 10k+ words smoothly

### Accessibility
- **Implemented comprehensive keyboard navigation** and ARIA labels, ensuring the application is fully accessible and follows WCAG guidelines

### Problem Solving
- **Solved offline-first data persistence challenge** by implementing IndexedDB wrapper with error handling, quota management, and graceful degradation
